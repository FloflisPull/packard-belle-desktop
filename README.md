This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Goals

- [ ] exportable as a single lightly modifiable component
- [ ] documentation for the file system API to allow easy expandability of said component
- [ ] optimised bundles of this exported and the component library
- [ ] more writable features via local storage
- [ ] server side rendering is more feasible (usage of window currently makes that hard)
- [ ] conversion of data files to work via JSON
- [ ] writable features communicate with server (allowing users to log in)
- [ ] Semi-working My Computer folder (e.g. contains a floppy disc icon that freezes the whole machine for 10 seconds before saying no floppy is inserted)
- [ ] Improved mobile operations
- [ ] Blue screen on all crashes
- [ ] Napster simulator (I've never actually used Napster so if you have then this will suck)
- [ ] collection of easy additional components to write (e.g. calculator)
- [ ] windows XP skin (should be pretty doable and able to be it's own CSS file with how the componets are written)

If you'd like me to focus on any of these please consider donating https://www.buymeacoffee.com/padraig I will give most of this away to charity if anyone actually does donate. If you'd like to add them yourself I'd love to help make it happen!

# Logging Hacks

Hack styles should either be flagged or placed within the root css file
All resizable windows feature a lot of repetition atm
Internet Explorer is a mess now and whenever I get around to it it'll need documentation all of its own
